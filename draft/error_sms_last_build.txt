        Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
        variable "CXX" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the full path
        to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.

********************************************************************************
    scikit-build could not get a working generator for your system. Aborting build.
      
    Building Linux wheels for Python 3.11 requires a compiler (e.g gcc).
    But scikit-build does *NOT* know how to install it on ubuntu
      
    To build compliant wheels, consider using the manylinux system described in PEP-513.
    Get it with "dockcross/manylinux-x64" docker image:
      
    https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross#readme
      
    For more details, please refer to scikit-build documentation:
