`galaxy-chop` is a Python code that tackles the dynamical decomposition problem
by utilizing clustering techniques in phase space for stellar galactic 
components.

It runs in numerical N-body simulations populated with Semi-analytical models
and full Hydrodynamical simulations, such as Illustris TNG.
